# German Linguistics in Heidelberg: Citations
Welcome to the German Linguistics in Heidelberg Citations project! üìö This endeavor aims to create a citation style tailored to the guidelines outlined in the [Vademecum](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/md/neuphil/gs/abteilungen/linguistik/vademecum_germanistische_linguistik_final.pdf) for German Linguistics at Heidelberg University.

## Project Status
üöß Work in Progress: Please note that this project is an ongoing effort, and no elements are considered final at this stage.

## Zotero Citation Style
The current focus is on a citation style designed for Zotero. While it is functional for standard entry types, be aware that there are known bugs, especially for more uncommon document types.
To use the style in Zotero, simply open the `universitat-heidelberg-germanistische-linguistik.csl` file with Zotero by right-clicking.

## LaTeX Citation Style
The included LaTeX citation style is a modified version of the `authoryear` style. It is designed to be used with the `biblatex` package.
In order to use the style, follow these steps:

1. Add the `biblatex.cfg` file to your project directory.
2. Add the following lines to your LaTeX document:
    ```latex
    \usepackage[backend=biber, style=authoryear]{biblatex}
    \addbibresource{your_bibliography.bib}
    ```
