# German Linguistics in Heidelberg: Citations
Welcome to the German Linguistics in Heidelberg Citations project! 📚 This endeavor aims to create a citation style tailored to the guidelines outlined in the [Vademecum](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/md/neuphil/gs/abteilungen/linguistik/vademecum_germanistische_linguistik_final.pdf) for German Linguistics at Heidelberg University.

## Project Status
🚧 Work in Progress: Please note that this project is an ongoing effort, and no elements are considered final at this stage.

## Zotero Citation Style
The current focus is on a citation style designed for Zotero. While it is functional for standard entry types, be aware that there are known bugs, especially for more uncommon document types. 

## Future Plans: LaTeX Citation Style
I plan on releasing a LaTeX citation style in the future.

## How to Contribute
